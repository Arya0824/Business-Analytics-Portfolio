 Stakeholders & Requirement Elicitation — Notes

In any business analysis work, identifying the right stakeholders early
is extremely important. Stakeholders are the people who influence or are
affected by the solution.

If the wrong stakeholders are involved (or some are missed), requirements
often turn out incomplete or incorrect later in the project.

Requirement elicitation is how a BA understands what stakeholders actually
need. This usually happens through conversations rather than just documents.

Common ways to do this:
- One-on-one interviews
- Group discussions or workshops
- Reviewing existing documents
- Observing how current processes work

A key learning here is that good elicitation depends more on asking clear,
thoughtful questions than on using complex tools.
